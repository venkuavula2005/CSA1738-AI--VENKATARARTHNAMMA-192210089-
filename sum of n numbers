% sum_to_n(N, Sum) is true if Sum is the sum of integers from 1 to N

% Base case: The sum of numbers from 1 to 0 is 0
sum(0, 0).

% Recursive case: The sum of numbers from 1 to N is N + the sum of numbers from 1 to (N-1)
sum(N, Sum) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    sum(N1, Sum1),
    Sum is Sum1 + N.
