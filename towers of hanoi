% hanoi(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary) solves the Towers of Hanoi problem for N disks
% where Source is the starting peg, Target is the destination peg, and Auxiliary is the intermediate peg

% Base case: Move a single disk directly from Source to Target
hanoi(1, Source, Target, _) :-
    write('Move disk from '), write(Source), write(' to '), write(Target), nl.

% Recursive case: Move N disks from Source to Target using Auxiliary
hanoi(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    hanoi(M, Source, Auxiliary, Target), % Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary
    hanoi(1, Source, Target, Auxiliary),  % Move the remaining disk from Source to Target
    hanoi(M, Auxiliary, Target, Source). % Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Target
